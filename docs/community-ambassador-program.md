The Cardano Foundation – in line with its mission to grow the global Cardano community – established its Ambassador Program in 2018. The flagship program is designed to promote awareness and educate the wider community to drive the adoption of Cardano for better use cases.

## The Cardano Ambassador Program

*The Cardano community is privileged to have committed members.*

These active individuals drive adoption by going above and beyond their duties by offering timely, consistent and beneficial contributions to the project. These special people are Cardano Ambassadors.

Currently, the program includes more than 50 ambassadors of all ages and professions from almost 30 countries across the globe, with more individuals qualifying during each review cycle. Cumulatively, existing ambassadors produce content in more than two dozen languages.

In a bid to further strengthen the transparency and decentralization of the Cardano ecosystem, the Cardano Foundation introduced Phase 2 (Rewards) of the program in 2020 to motivate and recognize ambassadors for adding value to the community and enhancing Cardano’s brand. Phase 2 (Rewards) includes both monetary and non-financial rewards. The newest phase of the program contributes towards driving the adoption of Cardano through various means. 

## Ambassador Status

An Ambassadorship opens doors to the global Cardano community. Ambassadors are vital in increasing Cardano’s awareness; to explain what the project is all about to a worldwide audience and provide insights into specific aspects of Cardano.

Ambassadors are key contributors to the project with direct access to the teams building Cardano.

An Ambassadorship grants the following privileges:

* Get rewarded for your contribution;
* Direct lines to the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and IOHK through dedicated invite-only Ambassador Slack channel;
* Exclusive invitations to closed events, software previews and calls with our high-performing teams ahead of general public releases;
* Distinctive Ambassador profile badge on the Cardano Forum;
* Cardano-branded event swag to give out at your own offline events;
* Gain valuable experience within the blockchain industry and behind-the-scenes access to the Project;
* Greater involvement in decision-making processes by providing direct feedback to relevant Project officials.
