The term token locking refers to a specific period of time where a cryptocurrency token is reserved. It brings a defensive procedure to keep a stable and long-term value of a specific asset by the concept of time-locking. In other words, you will be able to reserve a specific number of tokens that are issued in the Cardano network for a defined time interval.

:::note you can perform token locking on ada or any other tokens issued within the Cardano blockchain system.

# Token Locking With Allegra Hard Fork

Allegra represents the name of the hard fork which brings token locking mechanism to the blockchain network. Within the Cardano network, the hard fork happens smoothly with minimal disruption for the network participants and the network keeps generating new blocks without any interruption.

The hard fork combinator, original blocks with current block production rules are combined with new blocks with new block production rules, allows the blockchain network to get a smooth transition from the current Shelley protocol version 2.0 to the next protocol version 3.0 which is called Allegra. This allows the network to extend the original chain history with the new blocks that are minted after the protocol has been changed and automatically preserves the history of previous blocks.

While in other blockchain systems, once a hard fork happens then the whole network stops the process of generating new blocks and needs to recreate the chain from the beginning using the new protocol. Only after nodes synchronization then the network can start generating blocks again. So in the case of other blockchain systems, the hard fork causes the chain history to be erased and the block production to be restarted which can lead to splits in the chain.

## Token Locking on Cardano Blockchain vs Other Blockchains

In other blockchain systems, the token locking mechanism does not allow the reserved tokens to be transacted or traded. In Cardano blockchain, you can still trade your locked tokens and even participate in the process of stake delegation.

## Benefits of Token Locking

The main reason for the feature of token locking is because Cardano has different projects called Catalysts and those catalysts happen independently from the hard forks. So basically itâ€™s a treasury for Cardano that happens on a separate blockchain but to allow network participants to vote for a specific Catalyst, a partipante will need to lock his tokens on mainnet and then vote for treasury proposals on the catalyst chain. It also provides an important voting role for the Voltaire decentralized  governance functionality which will enable the Cardano community to decide on software updates, technical improvements, and project funding. ada holders can lock their tokens during a voting period to only secure their voting rights as long as they continue to hold those tokens which will protect the voting procedure against double counting the vote.

In addition, this feature will enable the smart contracts to support certain conditions such as making users hold tokens for a fixed period of time in order to complete a contract.

# Token Locking General Use-cases

There are different use-cases of the feature token locking such as vesting contractual future payout to allocate tokens over time and enabling distribution of future payouts to be automatically sent to any selected account. This section will explain some common use-cases for token locking.

## ICO

Token locking protects the process of raising funds during an ICO by preventing any trading option to sell or buy the tokens directly. That's why it applies to teams whose work is very important in making the company a success.

## Savings Account

You can use the token locking feature to create a savings account or a deposit certificate. For example, you can use it to save money in crypto for a specific reason such as a family saving account, a future purchase or a gift.

## HODL
As a cryptocurrency user, you may need to hold your tokens for a long time. this can be secured with token locking to guarantee that you will not be able to sell these tokens until a succeeding date.
