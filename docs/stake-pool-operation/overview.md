![Cardano Operate a Stake Pool](../../static/img/card-stake-pool-course-title.svg)

## Prerequisites 
*FIXME* Content placeholder.  
Manage expectations here for operating a stake pool. Do not push people away. In terms of the basic requirements for running a pool, we should be talking about knowledge and experience. Linux and networking skills, terminal and cli stuff, the ability to implement best practices, etc, we also want to manage expectations that not everyone should run a pool unless these people are willing to learn and read a ton. This is not easy content and should be written by good SPOs.

## Security
*FIXME* Content placeholder.   
Security above comforts and everything else. More mindset and less "change default SSH port". Maybe start with [learning about Cardano key pairs](cardano-keypairs).

## Stake Pool Course
A walk through how to set up manage and maintain your stake pool to ensure optimal performance and profitability.
[Start today with the course](../stake-pool-course/overview).

## Marketing
If you are a stake pool operator, you may have already noticed that it is not enough to have a technically flawless stake pool running. 

You also have to build your pool around a brand that manages to attract enough stake (delegators) within the Cardano community. [Read here for a few ideas on how you can do that](marketing-stake-pool).

## Resources
*FIXME* Content placeholder.  
If we don't get enough content in to the portal at launch, we link to everything.   
Also: What about community resources? Guild tools, CNCLI etc
