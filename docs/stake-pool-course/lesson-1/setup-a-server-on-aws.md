To complete this course you need a Linux System. If you have a computer running linux you are all set to start setting up your node. If not, you have options: Use Virtual Box to setup a virtual machine on your Windows or MacOS machine, or use a cloud server to run your node. In the next lesson we guide you through the process of setting up a server on AWS.
