## Topology files

This lesson explains how to prepare your topology files so that the relay node talks to other relays in the network and to the core node and make it to connect ONLY with the relay node, as shown in the following video tutorial:

## Register stake pool and metadata

Among other things this will allow your pool to be discovered by other pools \(and add you to their topology\) and integrate your pool with Daedalus and Yoroi wallets so that potential delegators can easily delegate their stake to you.

This lesson explains how to register your stake pool and its metadata to the blockchain, as shown in the following video tutorial:
