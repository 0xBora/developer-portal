In this article, you can find out what opportunities are available to get your project funded and how types of funding are bringing on-chain governance to the Cardano blockchain by allowing the community to self-determine priorities for growth.

## Types of Funding

If you are looking for funding opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem, You can choose one of two different funding types to promote the development of important projects that will further develop the overall ecosystem.

Cardano supports two different types of funding:
* cFund, centralized funding
* dFund, decentralized funding

### cFund

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a venture fund that manages all centralized fund operations secured by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) and [Wave Financial](https://wavegp.com/) where each of them participated with 10$ million to back ambitious founders globally.

The **cFund** started in July 2020 with different important aims:
* Growing the Cardano ecosystem.
* Working with governments, especially in developing countries in Africa and South America.
* Providing access to high-speed, adaptable financing for founders to be able to manage payment flows and invest in the Cardano ecosystem.

The first **cFund** investment took place In April 2021, it provided $500,000 to innovative enterprise-grade fintech technology called [COTI the currency of the internet](https://coti.io/). **COTI** secured the investment to support stakeholder-driven payment solutions and enables them to pack digitally any currency.
