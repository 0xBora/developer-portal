![Cardano Fund a Project](../../static/img/card-funding-title.svg)

Find out what opportunities are available to get your project funded and how types of funding are bringing on-chain governance to the Cardano blockchain by allowing the community to self-determine priorities for growth.

## Types of funding

Choose one of two different funding types to promote the development of important projects that will further develop the overall ecosystem.

* dcFund, decentralized funding (Project Catalyst)
* cFund, centralized funding

## dcFund (Project Catalyst)

The **dcFund** or decentralized fund is represented with [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) aiming to provide a safe and lively environment to explore the highest potential of human collaboration. The funds for this come directly from the Cardano Treasury and they are quite high compared to the **cFund**.

Visit the [dcFund section](../funding/dcfund) to understand how to submit a proposal through Project Catalyst.

:::tip Catalyst Announcements and Timeline
The best way to keep up to date with Project Catalyst is to follow [the announcement channel on Telegram](https://t.me/cardanocatalyst). 

There is also a community-developed page on [Project Catalyst timelines](https://cardanocataly.st/funds/), but please be aware that there is a lot of movement and the information there could be out of date.

## cFund

The [cFund](https://cfund.vc/) is a venture fund that manages all centralized fund operations secured by [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) and [Wave Financial](https://wavegp.com/) where each of them participated with 10$ million to back ambitious founders globally. Compared to Project Catalyst, the funds available here are rather small.

The **cFund** started in July 2020 with different important aims:
* Growing the Cardano ecosystem.
* Working with governments, especially in developing countries in Africa and South America.
* Providing access to high-speed, adaptable financing for founders to be able to manage payment flows and invest in the Cardano ecosystem.

The first **cFund** investment took place In April 2021, it provided $500,000 to innovative enterprise-grade fintech technology called [COTI the currency of the internet](https://coti.io/). **COTI** secured the investment to support stakeholder-driven payment solutions and enables them to pack digitally any currency.
