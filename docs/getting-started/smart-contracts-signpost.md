The Cardano Developer Portal covers everything that is available on the mainnet. If you've come here to learn about smart contracts, here are some links to get you started.

## Get started with Marlowe 
Marlowe is the domain-specific language for financial contracts on Cardano. 
Take a look at the [Marlowe Tutorial](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/tutorial/index.html) if you want to learn Marlowe from the beginning or dive straight into the [Marlowe Playground](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/). 

Talk to others about [Marlowe on the Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-marlowe/149) or if you prefer Telegram there is a dedicated [Marlowe Telegram Group](https://t.me/IOHK_Marlowe).

## Get started with Plutus 
Plutus is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain.
Take a look at the [Plutus Tutorial](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/tutorial/index.html) if you want to learn Plutus from the beginning or dive straight into the [Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io).

Talk to others about [Plutus on the Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cardano-plutus/148) or if you prefer Telegram we welcome you to the [Cardano Developers Telegram Group](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial).

## Get started with Haskell
Haskell is the the programming language for Plutus contracts. If you are looking for the best guide to Haskell and unsure where to start, we recommend you check out the book or website [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction) by Miran Lipovaƒça. 

Learning Haskell is made easy with this illustrated guide, one of the most engaging ways to learn this fascinating programming language.
