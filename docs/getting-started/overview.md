![Cardano Get Started](../../static/img/card-getting-started-title.svg)

Welcome to the Cardano Developer portal. This category will help you find your way around quickly. 

It is noteworthy to mention that the Developer Portal covers everything you can currently do on the Cardano mainnet. If your goal is to learn about Cardano's [smart contracts](smart-contracts-signpost), please visit [this signpost article](smart-contracts-signpost) to get you up to speed.

## What is Cardano? 
Cardano is a collection of open-source, patent-free protocols. It's a platform that enables you to store, transform, and manage value, identity and governance. 

## How did it start?
FIXME

## What you need to bring
To get the most out of the Cardano Developer Portal, you should already have programming experience and understand basic blockchain concepts. Terms like nodes, blocks, signatures, transactions, keys and hashes should not be foreign words. 

In case you are unfamiliar with these terms, start with the [stake pool course](../stake-pool-course/overview), even if you don't want to run a stake pool. The [course](../stake-pool-course/overview) will help you understand basic concepts.
